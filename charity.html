While it doesn’t not include the impact of the Latino population in general, it does show how immigrants from all over the world are coming to call our South Bend Region home.</p>

        <span class="card-title">Reins of Life</span>
        <p>Reins of Life (ROL) was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1978.  That year, Reins provided 32 hours of therapeutic riding lessons for 16 riders. Classes were held in the backyards of friends of ROL. From 1978-1991 Reins used borrowed arenas, equipment, and tack to provide services to individuals with disabilities of St. Joseph County, Indiana.  Dedicated volunteers transported borrowed horses by trailer to the lesson sites each day.  In 1991, the organization found a permanent home when Nancy and Lloyd Taylor donated twenty acres of their land on Quince Road, near Lydick.  Reins of Life now serves over 500 riders with 3,000 hours of lesson time annually for residents of 10 counties in Indiana and Michigan.
